- TEST EVERYTHING FIRST
- Create edit form for a user account
- Possibly abstract <% if logged_in? and current_user == @user %> into some kind of helper,
	kind of like admin_area
- Navigation: add a link to "all authors"
- Double check whether current_user == @user works. Not sure how to test equality
- Change it so the user simply logs in with their email if possible
	- I think this means destroying the "login" column
	- or, maybe it is smart enough to log in using the email if no login text box was present
- Add better formatting to the description (html? markdown? textile?)
- Create a migration associating users with projects:
	script/generate migration add_authorship_to_projects
	t.belongs_to :user
- Create some addition fields for users:
	t.string :name
- Decide whether a user's projects should show at /users/5 or at /users/5/projects
	- In that case, you would need to route users so that they have_many :projects
	- Or, in order to solve the problem of making the show action restricted for some 
	cases and not others, I could put the profile at /users/5/projects
- Consider categories instead of tagging
- Commenting?
- Gravatars?
