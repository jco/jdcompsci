- Possibly add a Library model for jars that are made available to every project
- TEST EVERYTHING FIRST
- Possibly abstract <% if logged_in? and current_user == @user %> into some kind of helper,
	kind of like admin_area
- maybe refactor the /account path, not needed?
- Navigation: add a link to "all authors"
- Double check whether current_user == @user works. Not sure how to test equality
- Add better formatting to the description (html? markdown? textile?)
- Consider categories instead of tagging
- Commenting?
- Gravatars?
